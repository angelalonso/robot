# Base Shopping List to get your Robot up and running
- Raspberry pi 1 B+. Probably anything newer will even work better.
  - A Wifi dongle like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7611ULB-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-Adapter/dp/B01KVZB3A4/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=edimax+wifi+dongle&qid=1599231989&sr=8-2)
- [Bought this pack for the following:](https://www.banggood.com/Geekcreit-DIY-L298N-2WD-Ultrasonic-Smart-Tracking-Moteur-Robot-Car-Kit-for-Arduino-products-that-work-with-official-Arduino-boards-p-1155139.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=UK)
  - L298N as motor controller. Check [L298N.md](L298N.md).
  - 2 motors  
  - 2 wheels
  - [Battery Holder for 4 AA Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/4-aa-battery-holder/s?k=4+aa+battery+holder)
    - I actually use 6x AA Batteries, after adding a 2xAA battery holder from an old toy.
    - See [this one](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/AA-Battery-Holder-Black/dp/B06XYLMD7K/ref=psdc_3578331_t1_B00A9C852E) for an example of something to buy instead
- Several Jumper cables Male, female...get from both.
- A lot of 3mm nuts and bolts to fix chips to the chassis. 
  - I use a couple of these [boxes](https://thepihut.com/products/white-nylon-screw-and-stand-off-set-m2-5-thread?variant=12364072779838&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic), but I am not completely happy with them
  - Smaller metallic ones for attaching sensors are definitely a good thing to have around, but I got mine from old toys.
- [Anker Powercore 20100](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Powerbank-Kapazit%C3%A4t-Technologie-Schwarz/dp/B00VJT3IUA). There is a newer model and I guess it will also work.
- [6 AA Rechargeable Batteries, with charger](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=4+aa+batteries+rechargeable&crid=2STSMJD1H4YUX&sprefix=4+aa+batteries+rechargeable%2Caps%2C193&ref=nb_sb_noss)
- Like I said above: a Battery Holder for 2x AA Batteries from some old toy
- Chassis made of 2 A4 Plywood sheets and a plastic Lunchbox (feel free to do your own thing here)

## A different kind of Shopping list: your laptop
- I use ubuntu LTS
- Install the arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
