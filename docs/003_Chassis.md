# Building a chassis for our robot

First of all, this is a temporary solution. I have built several "chassises" for this project before and I am pretty sure the best option is to 3D print something.

For the time being, you can put together a useful structure if you keep the following in mind:

- You need the structure to leave enough room for all components and cables
- The more open your structure is, the easier it will be to work on it
- The default chassis I got with my robotic kit (see [Shopping List](./000_ShoppingList.md)) was too small
- Weight should be distributed evenly. The battery will take most of that weight

## My build

I took an old plastic lunch box that was 16.5cms x 11.5cms and had at least a height (bottom to middle cut) of 3cms.

I cut it in two, removed some unneeded platic at the borders and prepared some holes to fix the motors

Then added some more holes to put both layers together. I used some garbage plastic to put both together but I'll probably have to change that piece because it's too flexible.

We will call that thing our chassis from now on.

I put all components together on top of the chassis to decide on the best distribution possible. Bear in mind that you will want to add some more elements in the future.
