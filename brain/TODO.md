- Shorter start time on raspberry
- More precise 
  - Make sleep variable on node_arduino be read from a config file
  - Sometimes SENSOR message arrives cut, but arduino itself saw no change...maybe we want to avoid checking for repeated values on arduino itself and move hat to robot?
- record inputs and use as test inputs
