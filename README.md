# Robot

A step by step Guide to building and configuring YOUR own robot using MY choice of Hardware and Software.

## TL;DR

This is a guide, not some code you install and run. There is reading involved.

If you cannot live without a step by step, here it goes:
- Calm down
- Relax
- Get to [Features and Examples](README.md#features-and-examples), click and read each one.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a project to learn that would have me entertained for longer than a month.
- As a kid I used to dream of having a Robot at home, like a pet but more advanced.

## Status

Working but not stable enough to leave your robot around kids or pets.

## Code Style

Using ROS2 with Python mostly, looking for a way to have Rust added to the formula.

## Screenshots

To be done

## Built with

- [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html)
- [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)
  - [Bash autocompletion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Consider the above also a list of minimum requirements.

## Features and Examples

This Guide will allow you to:
- [x] Put together some Hardware that you can use for your base Robot. [[1]](docs/000_ShoppingList.md) [[2]](docs/001_Setup.md) [[3]](docs/004_Chassis.md)
- [x] Configure the Software that makes the communication between all that HW work like a proper Robot (Conditions may apply). [[1]](docs/002_Raspberry.md) 

## API reference

Not everything in life has to be an API, right? at least not yet.
