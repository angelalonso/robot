# Robot

A step by step guide to building and configuring YOUR own robot using MY choice of Rust-based logic.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a project to learn Rust that would have me entertained for longer than a month.
- As a kid I used to dream of having a Robot at home, like a pet but more advanced.
