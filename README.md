# Robot

A step by step Guide to building and configuring YOUR own robot using MY choice of Rust-based logic.

## TL;DR

This is a guide, not some code you install and run. There is reading involved.

If you cannot live without a step by step, here it goes:
- Calm down
- Relax
- Get to [Features and Examples](README.md#features-and-examples), click and read each one.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a project to learn Rust that would have me entertained for longer than a month.
- As a kid I used to dream of having a Robot at home, like a pet but more advanced.

## Status

Working but not stable enough to leave your robot around kids or pets.

## Code Style

Terrible

## Screenshots

To be done

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

## Features and Examples

This Guide will allow you to:
- [x] Put together some Hardware that you can use for your base Robot. [[1]](docs/000_ShoppingList.md) [[2]](docs/001_Setup.md) [[3]](docs/004_Chassis.md)
- [x] Configure the Software required to turn that HW into a proper Robot. [[1]](docs/002_Raspberry.md) [[2]](docs/003_Arduino.md)
- [x] Create a set of rules to "make your Robot do things" and deploy them to the Robot. [[1]](docs/005_FirstExample.md) [[2]](docs/006_MovingExample.md)
- [x] Test those rules with mocked sensors. [[1]](docs/007_TestingExample.md) [[2]](docs/007_TestingExample.md)
- [x] Use Robot's real data as mocks on tests. [[1]](docs/008_TestingWithRealMocks.md)
- [ ] Have the Robot launch on boot
- [ ] Add and callibrate position sensors
- [ ] Set the rules "on the go" with Reinforcement Learning instead of a rules YAML.
- [ ] Make the Robot compatible with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)

## API reference

Not everything in life has to be an API, right? at least not yet.
