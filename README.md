# Robot

A step by step Guide to building and configuring YOUR own robot using MY choice of Rust-based logic.

## Motivation

- I was looking for a project to learn Rust that would have me entertained for longer than a month.
- As a kid I used to dream of having a Robot at home, like a pet but more advanced.

## Status

Working but not stable enough to leave your robot around kids or pets.

## Code Style

Terrible

## Screenshots

To be done

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

## Features and Examples

This Guide will allow you to:
- [x] Put together some Hardware that you can use for your base Robot.
- [x] Configure the Software required to turn that HW into a proper Robot.
- [x] Create a set of rules to "make your Robot do things".
- [x] Test those rules with mocked sensors
- [x] Deploy those rules to the Robot
- [ ] Have the Robot launch on boot
- [ ] Add and callibrate position sensors
- [ ] Set the rules "on the go" with Reinforcement Learning instead of a rules YAML.

## API reference

Not everything in life has to be an API, right? at least not yet.
